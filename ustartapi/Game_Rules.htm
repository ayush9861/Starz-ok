<p><strong>PRIORITY OF RULES:</strong></p>

The CAN-AM POLICE-FIRE GAMES FEDERATION rules shall supersede<br> all other rules.

<p><strong>AGE RULES:</strong></p>


    Age is determined as of the first day of competition in the sport entered.<br>
    A competitor may enter only their age division in an event, unless the<br> event has an OPEN Division, then the competitor may enter the<br> OPEN Division, but cannot enter both.<br>
    A competitor who qualifies as a Senior may compete in a Senior<br> Doubles event and an Open Single event, but may not compete in a Senior<br> and Open Singles event.

<p><strong>DOUBLES/PARTNERS</strong></p>

Competitors may enter only one sport/event classification. Competitors<br> entering sports/events that offer doubles competition may<br> only enter the Open Classification or the Classification of the<br> youngest member of the doubles team. For example: Two competitors, one<br> age 31 and the other 57 want to enter Racquetball Doubles. They<br> may enter the Open Classification or the Senior Classification<br> because of the age of the youngest team member.<br>

<strong><p>TEAM RULE:</strong></p>

    National, State or Provincial law enforcement, fire service or e.m.s.<br> agencies may combine with members of the same agency from throughout<br> the Country, State, or Province to form a team.<br>
    Any Department/Detachment/Service with less than 100 eligible<br> members may team up with another local<br>
    Department/Detachment/Service of less than 100 eligible members<br> within the same State or Province, as long as there is no emphasis on<br> selecting an “all-star” team. Games’ coordinators shall approve all team entries.<br>
    Coaches: Non-playing coaches or managers who are not team members<br> are not eligible to receive Games medals. Non-playing<br> coaches are eligible to receive medals provided they meet the same<br> requirements as all other entrants and register in the same manner, including entry fee.<br>
    A Team must enter the classification of the youngest member of the<br> team or the Open Classification. For example, a 3-Player Basketball Team<br> has two members age 47 and one age 35. The team may enter either the<br> Open Classification or the 35 Years & Over Classification but not both.<br>

<strong><p>Classifications</strong></p>

In certain sports/events, ten year age increments in individual/singles<br> competition have been established as follows:

<strong><p>Grand Master “E” </strong></p>	70 years of age and older

In certain sports/events, the classification for Men of “40 years & over” and<br> for Women “35 years & over” has been established to provide greater competition:<br>

Men: “40 years & over” The exception is Hockey, which will use 35yrs&Over.

Women: “35 years & over”

<strong><p>Unisex– </strong></p>Shall refer to sports where either men or women may compete in the same classification.

<strong><p>Coed</strong></p>Shall refer to sports where both genders must compete in the specified ratio, in the same classification.<br>

Some sports/events may have Light, Medium, and Heavy as weight classes.<br> The Host may adjust the weight classes depending upon the number of participants in each division.<br>

Individual Competitors may enter only ONE classification per sport/event; EITHER age/weight classification OR Open.<br> Subject to the Team Rules below, they may also compete as a partner in Doubles or another team within the same sport/event.<br>

<strong><p>Team Substitutions:</strong></p>

Substitutions must be made through the host agency’s sport coordinator if<br> before the games, or at the games Headquarters if during the games.

Substitutions may be made any time prior to the first day of competition as<br> long as the substitution procedures are followed.

The team captain must make substitutions. The captain must provide a<br> complete registration and signed waiver for the substitute and additional fees if needed.

All substitutes must meet the same requirements as the original entries.<br>

All substitution applications must be completed prior to the first competition<br> of that team. (Or doubles team)

It is the responsibility of the substitute and team captain to request the<br> substitution far enough ahead of the actual competition to allow the host<br> agency time to meet its responsibilities.

The sport coordinator must be supplied a copy of the substitute’s application in a timely fashion.<br>

No substitutions will be allowed in singles events.

Only one (1) substitution will be allowed on any team event with less than five members. (Includes team doubles).

<strong><p>Duplicate Entries:</strong></p>

A competitor may enter only one doubles event with only one partner in any sport.

<strong><p>Exception:</strong></p> A competitor may enter mixed doubles and the correct gender doubles competition.

A competitor may be on only one team in any one sport.

<strong><p>Uniforms:</strong></p>

Clothing must be clean and so designed and worn as not to make an<br> indecent display of the competitor’s person. It shall be the duty of the sport<br> coordinator in charge to see that each and every competitor is<br> properly attired in their given sports.

<strong><p>Men’s and Women’s Events:</strong></p>

Men and Women will compete together except where there are separate<br> men and women’s classes.

<strong><p>Bracketing Weight Sports:</strong></p>

In weight class sports (arm wrestling, body building, bench press and<br> power lifting) competitors will weigh in before their events. At that time,<br> competitors will be bracketed according to their actual weight at weigh-in.<br> The weigh in time will either be communicated to each competitor<br> or posted at the registration booth at games headquarters.

When the bracketing is completed the competition will be held and medals awarded.

<strong><p>Sport Registration:</strong></p>

Each competitor must attend and check-in at the Registration Center at the<br> Games Headquarters prior to competing in the games. At this time<br> they must present their Agency Identification, verify all fees have<br> been paid for all events they have entered and receive their<br> games Identification Card Participant Pass (as provided by the host).<br>

Competitors will be required to produce their Games identification when<br> attending the on-site check-in location at the sports venue. It is<br> suggested that the registration site not be moved and that the event<br> coordinator be available to verify the team rosters and fees at the event site.

<strong><p>Intimidation:</strong></p>

Competitors will not be allowed to intimidate or influence a coordinator<br> regarding rule changes.

Setting rules by polling the competitors is not permitted. The rulebook is<br> the last word in any dispute.

<strong><p>Late Competitors:</strong></p>

Scheduling will be adhered to.

<strong><p>Competitors as Officials:</strong></p>

If the sport rules allow competitors to officiate, they may be used as<br> officials. However, they may not officiate games/matches, which include<br> competitors from their own agency.

<strong><p>Alcohol:</strong></p>

The Can-Am Police-Fire Games Federation has a general policy that<br> prohibits alcoholic beverages from being consumed during competition by<br> competitors and is prohibited from the field or primary area of competition.<br> Violators of this rule may be disqualified. However, the Host may permit alcohol in circumstances that do not place a participant in<br> an unsafe environment or cause a negative perception to the Federation and Host.<br>

Spectators may consume alcoholic beverages as long as they are separated from the area of competition.<br>

The host agency or its representatives must not provide or allow any<br> alcoholic beverages to be served to anyone under the influence of alcohol<br> or to anyone who becomes under the influence of alcohol due to this service.

<strong><p>Medals:</strong></p>

Only CAN-AM POLICE-FIRE GAMES Medals will be awarded for athletic<br> performance. Medals will be awarded to the first through third<br> place finishers. Awards will be made on-site immediately<br> following the events where possible.

Exception: When a protest is lodged that might affect the places. The sport<br> coordinator will hold those medals pending the outcome of the protest.<br>

A competitor MUST have COMPETED in a classification in order to be<br> eligible to receive a medal for that classification. Registration only for a<br> classification does not satisfy this requirement and no medal shall be awarded in this case.

<strong><p>Protests:</strong></p>

All protests must be lodged with the sport coordinator or his designee<br> immediately after the violation. The sport coordinator or his designee has<br> final decision. On significant protests the Host or sport/event coordinator<br> will request the CAN-AM POLICE-FIRE GAMES FEDERATION representative make the final decision.<br>

Serious violations of CAN-AM POLICE-FIRE GAMES sport or event rules<br> may result in disqualification (violence, cheating, etc.)

<strong><p>Admission Charges:</strong></p>

There will be no charge for spectators in any of the CAN-AM POLICE-FIRE<br> GAMES sporting events. The only exception is for an Opening Ceremony if<br> provided, however, no registered competitor may be charged for attending.<br>

Should there be less than three participants in any age category,<br> participants in that category will automatically be moved to the closest<br> lower age category or next highest weight division.
